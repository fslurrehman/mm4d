# Project Detail:
In wake of COVID19, I created this repo to evaluate existing mathematical models to understand spread of diseases especially the pandemic like Corona Virus 19. It is based on the SIR (Susceptible Infected Recover) Model.

It contains a workbook named covid19sir.ipynb. You can run this to simulate the spread of disease for given population.  It is based on numberphile youtube video which you can watch from notebook. It can be helpful in identifying key indicators like number of days/weaks after which peak will occur, number of total possible infected people etc. 

# todo:
1. Adding more plots to comparison of data of other country or region.
2. Adding more models other than (SIR)
3. Highlighting key indicators/outputs
